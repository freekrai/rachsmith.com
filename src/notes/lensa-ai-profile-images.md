I already had the Lensa app on my phone, so I paid $9.99 AUD for 100 of their AI generated "magic avatars" just to see what would happen.

For the source images, I purposefully included pictures without makeup and in bad lighting that truly show my age. And yet every image it spit out looks like me if I was 20 and a little bit prettier.

<div style="max-width: 300px; margin: 0 auto;">
<img alt="a stylized picture of me" src="/images/magic-pfp2.jpg" />
<img alt="a stylized picture of me" src="/images/magic-pfp3.jpg" />
<img alt="a stylized picture of me" src="/images/magic-pfp4.jpg" />
<img alt="a stylized picture of me" src="/images/magic-pfp5.jpg" />
<img alt="a stylized picture of me" src="/images/magic-pfp6.jpg" />
</div>

It was an unsurprising result from an app that people use to filter away any signs of ageing or skin texture, but I would have preferred if the results looked like the 36 year old me in the different styles! Oh well. It's also funny to me that even though I included smiling pictures in my source images, almost every generated image ended up with my trademark [RBF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_bitch_face).

Of all the images I think this one that actually looks the most like me, and I like the starry background so I will probably swap it in for my profile picture on socials.

<div style="max-width: 300px; margin: 0 auto;">
<img alt="a stylized picture of me" src="/images/magic-pfp1.jpg" />
</div>

This was the best glitch

<div style="max-width: 300px; margin: 0 auto;">
<img alt="a stylized picture of me" src="/images/magic-pfp7.jpg" />
</div>
